# partial-membership

# Idea
Normal membership inference attacks always require the adversary to have a full datapoint (i.e., all the attributes).
In this project, we want to carry out membership inferences with only a subset of the attributes.


To run this attack you would need to use a dataset "modified purchase 100"
